## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge really tested me on layout design and positioning and I really tried to include semantic HTML in this project but I think I did a bad job so I need to work on that further.

### Continued development

- Learn Semantic HTML
- Practice positioning and layouts.
